### Hi there 

Hello, my name is TechyGuy, but you can call me Techy! 
I work for Novastack Hosting (https://novastack.org) as head of IT and help with some development if needed. I also support and develop for a crypto project, Kryptokrona. Go check us out! You can find us both here on github and on https://kryptokrona.org
